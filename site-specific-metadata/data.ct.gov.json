The Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE) introduced the four-year cohort graduation rate with the graduating class of 2009. This approach was created when Connecticut and 49 other states signed an agreement with the National Governors\u2019 Association to develop a uniform system for tracking students. The four-year cohort graduation rate is calculated by tracking an individual cohort, or group of students, from their initial entrance into Grade 9 through to graduation. The four-year cohort graduation rate represents the percentage of students who earn a standard high school diploma within four years. The calculation uses individual student-level data from the state's Public School Information System (PSIS) that school districts submitted and superintendents certified.\r\n>> Double plus symbol (\u2020\u2020) denotes not applicable\r\n>> Asterisk symbol (*) denotes fewer than six in a cohort is suppressed\r\n>> Outplaced students are counted only in district graduation calculation\r\n>> Row percentages may not add to 100 percent because of rounding\r\n>> District graduation rates may not be the same as the average of the graduation rates of the number schools in that district because of outplaced students.\r\n>> Because each cohort is different from one year to another year, graduation rates are not comparable from year to year. Caution interpreting the differences between the previous year and the current year \r\n\r\nCohort Graduation Rate Documentation: http://www.sde.ct.gov/sde/lib/sde/PDF/EvalResearch/cohortgraddocumentation.pdf", "keyword": "education,district,graduation,ctkids", "format": "text/csv", "created": "2014-07-24", "modified": "2014-10-30", "releaseDate": "2014-07-24", "theme": "Education", "keywords": ["education", "district", "graduation", "ctkids"], "title": "District Cohort Graduation Rates: 2012", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/sus6-q2ti/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "text/csv", "label": "csv"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/sus6-q2ti/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/json", "label": "json"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/sus6-q2ti/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml", "label": "xml"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/sus6-q2ti/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml+rdf", "label": "rdf"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/sus6-q2ti/rows.xls?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/excel", "label": "xls"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/sus6-q2ti/rows.xlsx?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet", "label": "xlsx"}]}], "accessLevel": "Public", "webService": "https://data.ct.gov/resource/sus6-q2ti"}, {"accessURL": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/uxdv-m92a/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "feed": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/uxdv-m92a/rows.rss", "identifier": "uxdv-m92a", "description": "A listing of various online transactions available from the Connecticut State Agencies and Offices", "keyword": "ct,online,tansactions,egov", "format": "text/csv", "title": "State Of Connecticut Online Transaction Inventory", "created": "2014-06-25", "modified": "2014-10-31", "releaseDate": "2014-06-25", "theme": "Government", "keywords": ["ct", "online", "tansactions", "egov"], "license": "Public Domain\nDepartment of Administrative Services(http://www.ct.gov/das)", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/uxdv-m92a/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "text/csv", "label": "csv"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/uxdv-m92a/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/json", "label": "json"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/uxdv-m92a/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml", "label": "xml"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/uxdv-m92a/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml+rdf", "label": "rdf"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/uxdv-m92a/rows.xls?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/excel", "label": "xls"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/uxdv-m92a/rows.xlsx?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet", "label": "xlsx"}]}], "accessLevel": "Public", "webService": "https://data.ct.gov/resource/uxdv-m92a"}, {"accessURL": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/7hah-zeuv/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "feed": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/7hah-zeuv/rows.rss", "identifier": "7hah-zeuv", "description": "Location and phone numbers for all Department of Rehabilitation Services -

According to research conducted by the College Board*, a score of 1550 indicates that a student will have a 65 percent or greater likelihood of achieving a B- average or higher during the first year of college.\r\n\r\nThis dataset also provides an estimated SAT Participation Rate, which equals the number of SAT test-taking seniors in the district divided by the number of seniors enrolled in the district, as a percentage.  These participation rates are considered an estimate because the grade level of the SAT test-taker is self-reported by the student at the time of registration for the SAT while the total number of seniors enrolled in the district is reported to the Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE) by the district. These are the best available estimates of SAT participation rates.\r\n\r\nThe Benchmark Performance reflect the results of only those who participate in the SAT.  Because participation rates vary from district to district, the CSDE provides both the estimated Participation rates together with the Benchmark Performance in order to promote fair and valid

Census Blocks are statistical areas which in Connecticut are typically bounded by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad lines. Generally, Census Blocks in denser urban communities are small in area, such as a block in a city that is bounded on all sides by streets. However, Census Blocks in suburban and rural areas may be large, or irregular, and bounded by a variety of features, such as roads or streams. For example, a specific Census Block may be partially served by public water and/or sewer, and thus the entire block would appear to be served by these utilities. There were several instances during the public comment period where municipalities requested that certain Census Blocks be removed from this classification, and such requests were granted. Any limitations in the use of Census Blocks in this LGM should not be construed as influencing local land use and zoning decisions or municipal plans of conservation and development; nor should it create any expectation for future utility service where none currently exists.\r\nPriority Funding Areas are classified by Census Blocks that include: \uf0b7 Designation as an Urban Area or Urban Cluster in the 2010 Census Boundaries that intersect a \u00bd mile buffer surrounding existing or planned mass-transit stations Existing or planned sewer service from an adopted Wastewater Facility
