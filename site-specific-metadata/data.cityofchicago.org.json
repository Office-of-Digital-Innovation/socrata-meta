CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center and uses a computerized mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and efficiently schedule crews.  One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block.  Pothole repairs are generally completed within 7 days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, particularly frigid temps and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes.  On days when weather is cooperative and there is no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.  \r\n\r\nIf a previous request is already open for a buffer of 4 addresses the request is given the status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".  For example, if there is an existing CSR for 6535 N Western and a new request is received for 6531 N Western (which is within four addresses of the original CSR) then the new request is given a status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".\r\n\r\nOnce the street is repaired, the status in CSR will read \u201cCompleted\u201d for the original request and \"Duplicate (Closed)\" for any duplicate requests.

For a more detailed description, go to: http://bit.ly/Q9AZAD. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (nonfreeway\r\nstreets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every ten minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimate by traffic segments gives the observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.\r\n\r\nTraffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area).\r\nThis dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads.\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent\r\nintersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes.

Non-index offenses are all other types of criminal incidents, including vandalism, weapons violations, public peace violations, etc.", "keyword": "crime,police", "format": "text/csv", "created": "2011-09-15", "modified": "2014-10-28", "releaseDate": "2011-09-15", "theme": "Public Safety", "keywords": ["crime", "police"], "title": "Chicago Police Department - Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting (IUCR) Codes", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/c7ck-438e/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "text/csv", "label": "csv"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/c7ck-438e/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/json", "label": "json"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/c7ck-438e/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml", "label": "xml"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/c7ck-438e/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml+rdf", "label": "rdf"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/c7ck-438e/rows.xls?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/excel", "label": "xls"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/c7ck-438e/rows.xlsx?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet", "label": "xlsx"}]}], "accessLevel": "Public", "webService": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/c7ck-438e"}, {"accessURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/a2fk-ec6q/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "feed": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/a2fk-ec6q/rows.rss", "identifier": "a2fk-ec6q", "description": "This dataset contains estimates of the number of residents aged 5 years or older in Chicago who \u201cspeak English less than very well,\u201d by the non-English language spoken at home and community area of residence, for the years 2008 \u2013 2012.

For a detailed description, go to: http://bitly.com/TeqrNv. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). \r\n\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.", "keyword": "traffic,sustainability", "format": "text/csv", "created": "2011-11-19", "modified": "2015-05-31", "releaseDate": "2011-11-19", "theme": "Transportation", "keywords": ["traffic", "sustainability"], "title": "Chicago Traffic Tracker - Congestion Estimates by Regions", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/t2qc-9pjd/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "text/csv", "label": "csv"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/t2qc-9pjd/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/json", "label": "json"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/t2qc-9pjd/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml", "label": "xml"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/t2qc-9pjd/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml+rdf", "label": "rdf"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/t2qc-9pjd/rows.xls?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/excel", "label": "xls"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/t2qc-9pjd/rows.xlsx?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet", "label": "xlsx"}]}], "accessLevel": "Public", "webService": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/t2qc-9pjd"}, {"accessURL": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/thvf-6diy/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "feed": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/thvf-6diy/rows.rss", "identifier": "thvf-6diy", "description": "This dataset shows the location, first operational date, and approaches of the red light cameras in the City of Chicago.

These categories were established to help the City identify and regulate the various types of establishments serving alcoholic beverages. They are described at the following link: http://bit.ly/P0Gn4c. The Chicago City Council has passed a series of ordinances restricting the issuance of liquor licenses in various locations throughout the City in sections 4-60-022 and 4-60-023 of the Municipal Code. In general, consumption on premises liquor licenses are affected by the 022 moratorium and Package Goods are affected by the 023 moratorium. However, moratoriums can be complicated, so determining whether or not a moratorium applies to a specific license application is not always straightforward. Users of the data should contact the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection if they have any questions. These GIS layers show the locations of moratoriums passed by the City Council. It is updated monthly if any restrictions have been added or deleted. Columns are as follows: \u2022\tCODE refers to the specific ordinance passed by City County.
