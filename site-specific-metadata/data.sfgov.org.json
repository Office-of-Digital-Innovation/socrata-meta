Over thirty years of research has proven the risk to be \u201cbiologically significant\u201d for certain bird species.

While the facts are staggering, the solutions are within reach. The majority of these deaths are foreseeable and avoidable. The document summarizes proven successful remedies such as window treatments, lighting design, and lighting operation.  The bird refuge maps out areas of particular risk to birds.  These areas are within 300ft of: open water, inland water bodies greater than 2 acres in size, open space greater than 2 acres, the shoreline.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.", "keyword": "", "format": "application/zip", "created": "2013-10-04", "modified": "2014-08-14", "releaseDate": "2013-10-04", "theme": "Geographic Locations and Boundaries", "title": "Census 2010: Census Tracts for San Francisco (Zipped Shapefile format)", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "http://apps.sfgov.org/datafiles/view.php?file=sfgis/tl_2010_06075_tract10.zip", "formats": [{"value": "application/zip", "label": "zip"}]}], "accessLevel": "Public"}, {"accessURL": "https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/yg87-cd6v/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "feed": "https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/yg87-cd6v/rows.rss", "identifier": "yg87-cd6v", "description": "List of San Francisco Department of Public Health clinics offering flu vaccinations throughout the city in fall 2013.\r\n\r\nThis dataset complies with the  emerging Data Specification for Flu Shot Locations.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks.

private developers. In San Francisco, POPOS mostly appear in the Downtown office district area. Prior to 1985, developers provided POPOS under three general circumstances: voluntarily, in exchange for a density bonus, or as a condition of approval. The 1985 Downtown Plan created the first systemic requirements for developers to provide publicly accessible open space as a part of projects in C-3 Districts. The goal was to provide in the downtown quality open space in sufficient quantity and variety to meet the needs of downtown workers, residents and visitors.\r\n\r\nThe POPOs data is available in KML and GIS Shapefile format.  The zip file contains a .dbf file which can be viewed in Excel or other spreadsheet software.  The zip also contains a KML file of Public Artworks provided as part of the Downtown Plan requirement.  Download the data by clicking on the 'ZIP' button at the top right of this page.\r\n\r\nFor more information please visit the POPOS and Public Art website at http://popos.sfplanning.org", "keyword":
