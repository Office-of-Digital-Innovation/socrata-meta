The page provides examples on how to retrieve data from each of the fields within the dataset. A description of each field is also provided. This specific API page is for the Quality Assurance Reporting Requirements: Beginning 2008 dataset. As a way of monitoring managed care plan performance and improving the quality of care provided to New York State residents, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) collects data for four types of managed care insurance (commercial HMO, commercial Preferred Provider Organization, Medicaid managed care, and Child Health Plus) on an annual basis. Not all measures are collected each year. Some services require more resource intensive methods of collection, and these measures are collected every other year to reduce the burden associated with reviewing patient records. Refer to the Health Measures Descriptions document to learn about the specific measures included in this dataset. Measure specification changes and health plan mergers and closures preclude the ability to trend this data over time.
