This program is a cooperative program with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. QCEW data encompass approximately 97 percent of New York's nonfarm employment, providing a virtual census of employees and their wages as well as the most complete universe of employment and wage data, by industry, at the State, regional and county levels. \"Covered\" employment refers broadly to both private-sector employees as well as state, county, and municipal government employees insured under the New York State Unemployment Insurance (UI) Act. Federal employees are insured under separate laws, but are considered covered for the purposes of the program. Employee categories not covered by UI include some agricultural workers, railroad workers, private household workers, student workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers. QCEW data are similar to monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) data in that they reflect jobs by place of work; therefore, if a person holds two jobs, he or she is counted twice.

Please note that if the obesity rate value is blank on a given flyout, it means that obesity data for this school district and grade level could not be reported to the NYSDOH due to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).

This data set presents information on the amount of the distribution of these taxes back to the appropriate taxing jurisdictions during the ten most recent state fiscal years ended March 31. The state\u2019s sales tax is distributed to the state during the same month of collection. Generally, all local sales taxes collected are distributed back to the appropriate taxing jurisdiction in the month subsequent to collection. A large majority of the distributions reflect collections from taxable sales reported and remitted during the preceding month. However, the net distributions also include adjustments for prior taxable sales periods resulting from resolving returns processing exception issues, and are also affected by timing of remittances by sales tax vendors as determined by their annual amount of taxable sales. Local taxing jurisdictions\u2019 fiscal years are not identical to the state fiscal year. Distribution information in this data set is presented by state fiscal year to be consistent with other state tax collection information presented in the Annual Statistical Report of New York State Tax Collections.
