The HO CDI SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of CDI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital in 2013 to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent CDI rate data.  CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO CDI incidence include the type of CDI test used by the hospital, if the hospital is affiliated with a medical school, hospital bed size, and the burden of community-onset CDI in patients admitted to the hospital.  Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals\u2019 infections. For more precise comparisons, NHSN only calculates a SIR when at least one HO CDI is predicted, which is determined by patient volume and other factors predictive of acquiring CDI. However, we calculated the SIR for such hospitals with HO CDI predicted less than one if the number of HO CDI observed was greater than zero.  For each hospital with a CDI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number.  Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital\u2019s CDI SIR as: \r\n\u2022 No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, \r\n\u2022 Higher - high or more infections than predicted, or \r\n\u2022 Lower - low or fewer infections than predicted.\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf", "keyword": "bacterial,clostridium difficile,cross infection,epidemiology,healthcare,hospitals,nosocomial infections,surveillance", "format": "text/csv", "created": "2014-12-17", "modified": "2015-04-24", "releaseDate": "2014-12-17", "theme": "Diseases and Conditions", "keywords": ["bacterial", "clostridium difficile", "cross infection", "epidemiology", "healthcare", "hospitals", "nosocomial infections", "surveillance"], "title": "Clostridium Difficile Infections (CDI) In Hospitals, 2013", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/swz5-nhqr/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "text/csv", "label": "csv"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/swz5-nhqr/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/json", "label": "json"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/swz5-nhqr/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml", "label": "xml"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/swz5-nhqr/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml+rdf", "label": "rdf"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/swz5-nhqr/rows.xls?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/excel", "label": "xls"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/swz5-nhqr/rows.xlsx?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet", "label": "xlsx"}]}], "accessLevel": "Public", "webService": "https://cdph.data.ca.gov/resource/swz5-nhqr"}, {"accessURL": "https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/ijin-76i4/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "feed": "https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/ijin-76i4/rows.rss", "identifier": "ijin-76i4", "description": "This dataset contains positive cases of West Nile virus found in humans, 2006-present.

Similarly, a high SIR may reflect failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or more aggressive infection surveillance including more consistent application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols.

This table shows the hospital-specific central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) data by patient care locations in Special Care Areas. The CLABSI data for each hospital patient care location include number of CLABSIs, central line-days and patient days, CLABSI rates per 1000 line days and their 95% confidence intervals. We also performed a statistical analysis to determine if the rates are statistically higher, lower, or no different than California average rates. California average rates for 2013 can be found at http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/hai/Documents/2013-CLABSI-T1.pdf. CLABSI rates are affected by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and maintenance practices, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance methods. While stratifying CLABSI rates by patient care location makes rates more comparable, it cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI rates. A low CLABSI rate may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may reflect less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including failure to appropriately apply standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high rate may reflect failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or more aggressive infection surveillance including more consistent application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Finally, readers should consider comparisons between two time periods cautiously, as more time is needed to determine if changes will be sustained, and therefore, more meaningful.

The HO MRSA BSI SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of MRSA BSI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital in 2013 to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent MRSA BSI rate data.  MRSA BSI cases are classified as HO when the first positive blood test is obtained after the third day of hospitalization. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO MRSA BSI incidence include hospital bed size, affiliation with a medical school, and the community burden of MRSA BSI as observed in patients admitted to the hospital. Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals\u2019 infections. For more precise comparisons, NHSN only calculates a SIR when at least one HO MRSA BSI is predicted, which is determined by patient volume and other factors predictive of acquiring MRSA BSI. However, we calculated the SIR for such hospitals with HO MRSA BSI predicted less than one if the number of HO MRSA BSI observed was greater than zero. For each hospital with a MRSA BSI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number. Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital\u2019s MRSA BSI SIR as: \r\n\u2022 No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, \r\n\u2022 Higher - high or more infections than predicted, or \r\n\u2022 Lower - low or fewer infections than predicted.\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf", "keyword": "antibiotic resistance,antimicrobial resistance,bacterial infections,cross infection,delivery of health care,epidemiology,healthcare,hospitals,hospital infections,infection control,methicillin,microbial antibiotic resistance,microbial drug resistance,mrsa,multidrug resistance,multi-drug resistance,multiple drug resistance,nosocomial infections,staphylococcus aureus,surveillance", "format": "text/csv", "created": "2014-12-18", "modified": "2015-04-01", "releaseDate": "2014-12-18", "theme": "Diseases and Conditions", "keywords": ["antibiotic resistance", "antimicrobial resistance", "bacterial infections", "cross infection", "delivery of health care", "epidemiology", "healthcare", "hospitals", "hospital infections", "infection control", "methicillin", "microbial antibiotic resistance", "microbial drug resistance", "mrsa", "multidrug resistance", "multi-drug resistance", "multiple drug resistance", "nosocomial infections", "staphylococcus aureus", "surveillance"], "title": "Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Bloodstream Infections In Hospitals, 2013", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/x6ev-sgxq/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "text/csv", "label": "csv"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/x6ev-sgxq/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/json", "label": "json"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/x6ev-sgxq/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml", "label": "xml"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/x6ev-sgxq/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml+rdf", "label": "rdf"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/x6ev-sgxq/rows.xls?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/excel", "label": "xls"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/x6ev-sgxq/rows.xlsx?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet", "label": "xlsx"}]}], "accessLevel": "Public", "webService": "https://cdph.data.ca.gov/resource/x6ev-sgxq"}, {"accessURL": "https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/x39i-9t72/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "feed": "https://cdph.data.ca.gov/api/views/x39i-9t72/rows.rss", "identifier": "x39i-9t72", "description": "Long-term acute care is a hospital defined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as a licensed general acute care hospital providing care for patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay for all patients of greater than 25 days.
