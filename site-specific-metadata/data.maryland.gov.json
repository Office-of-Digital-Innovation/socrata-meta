These indicators are grouped into the following seven categories: student enrollment and demographics; dropout rate and high school completion; student attendance, suspensions and expulsions; elementary and middle school student achievement; high school performance; youth labor force participation; and youth civic engagement. The source of data for the Education and Youth section is provided by the Baltimore City Public School System, the American Community Survey and the Baltimore City Board of Elections. The data provided by the Baltimore City Public Schools includes student address, which allows BNIA-JFI to present data on educational performance by the neighborhood in which the student lives, not by the school attended. This allows BNIA-JFI to examine the relationship between community conditions and educational performance. Education and Youth indicators may not be directly comparable to data provided by either the Baltimore City Public School System or the Maryland Department of Education due to several reasons including differences in methodology used to create indicators, excluding students who cannot be matched between data files provided by BCPSS, and excluding students whose home address cannot be geocoded. In the 2009-2010 school year, 3.4% of the student addresses could not be matched or geocoded. This means that these students were not included in our analysis and not included in calculations for the City as a whole and therefore direct comparisons to data and results available through the Baltimore City Public Schools and the Maryland Report Card cannot be made.", "keyword": "education,bnia", "format": "text/csv", "title": "Education and Youth (2010-2013)", "created": "2015-05-14", "modified": "2015-05-14", "releaseDate": "2015-05-14", "theme": "Neighborhoods", "keywords": ["education", "bnia"], "license": "Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported\nThe Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance-Jacob France Institute at the University of Baltimore (known as BNIA-JFI)(http://bniajfi.org)\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/f9ua-ivaj/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "text/csv", "label": "csv"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/f9ua-ivaj/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/json", "label": "json"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/f9ua-ivaj/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml", "label": "xml"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/f9ua-ivaj/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml+rdf", "label": "rdf"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/f9ua-ivaj/rows.xls?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/excel", "label": "xls"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/f9ua-ivaj/rows.xlsx?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet", "label": "xlsx"}]}], "accessLevel": "Public", "webService": "https://data.maryland.gov/resource/f9ua-ivaj"}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/727n-cy2x/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "feed": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/727n-cy2x/rows.rss", "identifier": "727n-cy2x", "description": "Most indicators throughout Vital Signs are created by acquiring and analyzing data collected from governmental agencies for some public administration purpose, such as 311 calls or housing inspections.

Congress created the Community Development Block Grant Program under Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The primary objective is to develop viable communities, provide decent housing and a suitable living environment, and to expand economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) oversees the Program. The CDBG Program is comprised of two parts. The Entitlement Program is directly administered by HUD and provides Federal funds to large metropolitan \"entitlement\" communities. The States and Small Cities Program provides Federal funds to the States and Puerto Rico (with the exception of Hawaii) who then distribute funds to \"non-entitlement\" counties, small cities and towns. Congress allocates funds to the program annually. The Entitlement Program receives approximately 70% of the allocation and the remaining 30% is distributed to the States and Small Cities Program. Maryland's CDBG Program is administered by the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), in cooperation with the Maryland Department of Business and Economic Development (DBED). Funding Levels The State of Maryland receives its share of the 30% allocated to States and Small Cities based on poverty and population statistics. Maryland's Program is divided into two major funding categories: Community Development and Economic Development. Community Development receives approximately 72% of the allocation and Economic Development receives 25%. The remaining funds are spent for State administration of the Program (2% + $100,000) and technical assistance to grantees (1%). USES OF FUNDS CDBG funded projects must meet one of three national objectives: Principally benefits persons of low- and moderate- income Eliminates slum and blight Meets an urgent need of recent origin threatens public health and safety Eligible projects generally fall into three types: Housing Public facilities (water/sewer; streets; childcare, senior or community centers; shelters) Economic development projects Over a designated three-year period, the State must cumulatively use 70% of its allocation to benefit persons of low and moderate income CDBG funded programs must meet one of three national objectives: (1) Principally benefits persons of low- and moderate- income, (2) Eliminates slum and blight, and (3) Meets an urgent need of recent origin threatens public health and safety. Eligible projects generally fall into three types: (1) Housing, (2) Public facilities (water/sewer; streets; childcare, senior or community centers; shelters), and (3) Economic development projects. http://www.neighborhoodrevitalization.org/Programs/CDBG/CDBG.aspx", "keyword": "dhcd,housing,community development,block,grant,awards,cdbg", "format": "text/csv", "title": "Community Development Block Grant Awards (CDBG)", "created": "2014-11-05", "modified": "2015-04-21", "releaseDate": "2014-11-05", "theme": "Housing", "keywords": ["dhcd", "housing", "community development", "block", "grant", "awards", "cdbg"], "license": "Public Domain\nMD Department of Housing & Community Development (DHCD)(http://www.dhcd.maryland.gov/Website/Default.aspx)", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/qubt-bv3h/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "text/csv", "label": "csv"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/qubt-bv3h/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/json", "label": "json"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/qubt-bv3h/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml", "label": "xml"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/qubt-bv3h/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml+rdf", "label": "rdf"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/qubt-bv3h/rows.xls?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/excel", "label": "xls"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/qubt-bv3h/rows.xlsx?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet", "label": "xlsx"}]}], "accessLevel": "Public", "webService": "https://data.maryland.gov/resource/qubt-bv3h"}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/3w4d-kckv/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "feed": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/3w4d-kckv/rows.rss", "identifier": "3w4d-kckv", "description": "This data set contains the date, incident #, and location of officer involved use of force incidents that are investigated by the BPD Force Investigation Team (FIT).

Any mileage changes  are field verified by SHA's data collections crews.   \r\n\r\nAVMT is calculated by multiplying the AADT on a road segment by the segment length.

The source of data for the Education and Youth section is provided by the Baltimore City Public School System, the American Community Survey and the Baltimore City Board of Elections. The data provided by the Baltimore City Public Schools includes student address, which allows BNIA-JFI to present data on educational performance by the neighborhood in which the student lives, not by the school attended. This allows BNIA-JFI to examine the relationship between community conditions and educational performance. Education and Youth indicators may not be directly comparable to data provided by either the Baltimore City Public School System or the Maryland Department of\nEducation due to several reasons including differences in methodology used to create indicators, excluding students who cannot be matched between data files\nprovided by BCPSS, and excluding students whose home address cannot be geocoded.

These include: the number of neighborhood associations and block groups; the number of Community Development Corporations (CDCs); the number of umbrella organizations; the number of park stewardship groups; the number of\ncommunity gardens; Healthy Neighborhood Initiative locations; the number of historic properties; the percentage of the population registered to vote; and the percentage of persons voting.", "keyword": "community,neighborhoods,census", "format": "text/csv", "title": "Neighborhood Action & Sense of Community 2010", "created": "2013-02-26", "modified": "2014-10-28", "releaseDate": "2013-02-26", "theme": "Neighborhoods", "keywords": ["community", "neighborhoods", "census"], "license": "Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported\nBaltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance-Jacob France Institute at the University of Baltimore(http://www.bniajfi.org)\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/ipje-efsv/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "text/csv", "label": "csv"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/ipje-efsv/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/json", "label": "json"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/ipje-efsv/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml", "label": "xml"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/ipje-efsv/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml+rdf", "label": "rdf"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/ipje-efsv/rows.xls?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/excel", "label": "xls"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/ipje-efsv/rows.xlsx?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet", "label": "xlsx"}]}], "accessLevel": "Public", "webService": "https://data.maryland.gov/resource/ipje-efsv"}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/wasd-qc7e/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "feed": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/wasd-qc7e/rows.rss", "identifier": "wasd-qc7e", "description": "Listing of area dialysis centers developed by the Baltimore City Department of Health", "keyword": "health,dialysis", "format": "text/csv", "title": "Dialysis Centers", "created": "2011-12-14", "modified": "2014-10-28", "releaseDate": "2011-12-14", "theme": "Housing & Development", "keywords": ["health", "dialysis"], "license": "Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported\nBaltimore City Department of Health(http://www.baltimorehealth.org/)\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/wasd-qc7e/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "text/csv", "label": "csv"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/wasd-qc7e/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/json", "label": "json"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/wasd-qc7e/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml", "label": "xml"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/wasd-qc7e/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml+rdf", "label": "rdf"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/wasd-qc7e/rows.xls?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/excel", "label": "xls"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/wasd-qc7e/rows.xlsx?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet", "label": "xlsx"}]}], "accessLevel": "Public", "webService": "https://data.maryland.gov/resource/wasd-qc7e"}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/8hgq-9pi6/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "feed": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/8hgq-9pi6/rows.rss", "identifier": "8hgq-9pi6", "description": "This data set shows the location of museums within the City of Baltimore.

Managed by the Planning Section, BikeBaltimore includes anything bike related including implementing the Bicycle Master Plan, incorporating cycling in many transportation projects, installing bike racks and coordinating cycling events. The Bicycle Master Plan was developed by the Department of Planning in 2006. With the implementation of the Bicycle Master Plan, more bike facilities are appearing on city streets. There are many different types of bike facilities. Bike Lane: an area designated for bike travel only. The bike lane is a 5\u2019 wide lane with a bike symbol indicating that only bikes should use that lane, Sharrow: A roadway which is shared by bikes and automobiles. Cars should treat bikes as vehicles in the lane and pass when it is safe to do so, Signed Route: A roadway with no pavement markings, signed routes are used on low-traffic volume streets where cyclists can \u201ctake the lane\u201d. Cars should pass bikes when it is safe to do so. Signed routes typically have mileage and destination markers with route adjustments along the way, Floating Bike Lane: Used along off-peak temporary parking, floating bike lanes adjust to the presence of parked cars. If parked cars are not present, cyclists occupy the 5\u2019 bike lane along the curb. When parked cars are present, the cyclist travels in the designated area between the parked cars and vehicular travel lanes, Share The Road: When space does not exist for bike lanes, \u201cSHARE THE ROAD\u201d signs are installed to remind motorists that cyclists may be present. Here cyclists are encouraged to use the shoulder of the road, or travel to the right while avoiding \u201cdoor zones\u201d and roadside hazards, Shared Bus & Bike Lanes: On Pratt St, these lanes are only available to buses, bicycles and right turning vehicles", "keyword": "bike lanes,bike,transportation", "format": "text/csv", "title": "Bike Lanes", "created": "2012-03-26", "modified": "2014-10-28", "releaseDate": "2012-03-26", "theme": "Transportation", "keywords": ["bike lanes", "bike", "transportation"], "license": "Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported\nDepartment of Transportation(http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/Planning/BikeBaltimore.aspx)\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/xzfj-gyms/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "text/csv", "label": "csv"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/xzfj-gyms/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/json", "label": "json"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/xzfj-gyms/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml", "label": "xml"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/xzfj-gyms/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml+rdf", "label": "rdf"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/xzfj-gyms/rows.xls?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/excel", "label": "xls"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/xzfj-gyms/rows.xlsx?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet", "label": "xlsx"}]}], "accessLevel": "Public", "webService": "https://data.maryland.gov/resource/xzfj-gyms"}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/k5ry-ef3g/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "feed": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/k5ry-ef3g/rows.rss", "identifier": "k5ry-ef3g", "description": "This dataset contains a list of restaurants within Baltimore City.

expanding affordable housing opportunities, creating jobs, stabilizing neighborhoods, and improving overall quality of life.  \r\nCongress created the Community Development Block Grant Program under Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The primary objective is to develop viable communities, provide decent housing and a suitable living environment, and to expand economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) oversees the Program. \r\nThe CDBG Program is comprised of two parts. The Entitlement Program is directly administered by HUD and provides Federal funds to large metropolitan \"entitlement\" communities. The States and Small Cities Program provides Federal funds to the States and Puerto Rico (with the exception of Hawaii) who then distribute funds to \"non-entitlement\" counties, small cities and towns. \r\nCongress allocates funds to the program annually. The Entitlement Program receives approximately 70% of the allocation and the remaining 30% is distributed to the States and Small Cities Program.\r\nMaryland's CDBG Program is administered by the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), in cooperation with the Maryland Department of Business and Economic Development (DBED). \r\nFunding Levels The State of Maryland receives its share of the 30% allocated to States and Small Cities based on poverty and population statistics. Maryland's Program is divided into two major funding categories: Community Development and Economic Development. Community Development receives approximately 72% of the allocation and Economic Development receives 25%. The remaining funds are spent for State administration of the Program (2% + $100,000) and technical assistance to grantees (1%). USES OF FUNDS CDBG funded projects must meet one of three national objectives: Principally benefits persons of low- and moderate- income Eliminates slum and blight Meets an urgent need of recent origin threatens public health and safety Eligible projects generally fall into three types: Housing Public facilities (water/sewer; streets; childcare, senior or community centers; shelters) Economic development projects Over a designated three-year period, the State must cumulatively use 70% of its allocation to benefit persons of low and moderate income\r\nCDBG funded programs must meet one of three national objectives: (1) Principally benefits persons of low- and moderate- income, (2) Eliminates slum and blight, and (3) Meets an urgent need of recent origin threatens public health and safety.\r\nEligible projects generally fall into three types: (1) Housing, (2) Public facilities (water/sewer; streets; childcare, senior or community centers; shelters), and (3) Economic development projects.\r\nhttp://www.neighborhoodrevitalization.org/Programs/CDBG/CDBG.aspx", "keyword": "dhcd,housing,community,development,block,grant,federal,awards", "format": "text/csv", "title": "Community Development Block Grant Awards State FY 13", "created": "2013-11-21", "modified": "2014-10-30", "releaseDate": "2013-11-21", "theme": "Housing", "keywords": ["dhcd", "housing", "community", "development", "block", "grant", "federal", "awards"], "license": "Public Domain\nMaryland Department of Housing and Community Development(http://www.dhcd.maryland.gov/Website/Default.aspx)", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/8ugp-p5hz/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "text/csv", "label": "csv"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/8ugp-p5hz/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/json", "label": "json"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/8ugp-p5hz/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml", "label": "xml"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/8ugp-p5hz/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml+rdf", "label": "rdf"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/8ugp-p5hz/rows.xls?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/excel", "label": "xls"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/8ugp-p5hz/rows.xlsx?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet", "label": "xlsx"}]}], "accessLevel": "Public", "webService": "https://data.maryland.gov/resource/8ugp-p5hz"}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/srkw-68js/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "feed": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/srkw-68js/rows.rss", "identifier": "srkw-68js", "description": "This data represents the top arrest charge of those processed at Baltimore's Central Booking & Intake Facility.

These data map hub and corridor elements within the green infrastructure. The Green Infrastructure Assessment was developed to provide decision support for Maryland's Department of Natural Resources land conservation programs. Ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving soils, regulating climate, and maintaining hydrologic function, are all provided by the existing expanses of forests, wetlands, and other natural lands. These ecologically valuable lands also provide marketable goods and services, like forest products, fish and wildlife, and recreation. The Green Infrastructure serves as vital habitat for wild species and contributes in many ways to the health and quality of life for Maryland residents. To identify and prioritize Maryland's green infrastructure, we developed a tool called the Green Infrastructure Assessment (GIA). The GIA was based on principles of landscape ecology and conservation biology, and provides a consistent approach to evaluating land conservation and restoration efforts in Maryland. It specifically attempts to recognize: a variety of natural resource values (as opposed to a single species of wildlife, for example), how a given place fits into a larger system, the ecological importance of natural open space in rural and developed areas, the importance of coordinating local, state and even interstate planning, and the need for a regional or landscape-level view for wildlife conservation. The GIA identified two types of important resource lands - \"hubs\" and \"corridors.\" \n\nHubs typically large contiguous areas, separated by major roads and/or human land uses, that contain one or more of the following: Large blocks of contiguous interior forest (containing at least 250 acres, plus a transition zone of 300 feet) Large wetland complexes, with at least 250 acres of unmodified wetlands; Important animal and plant habitats of at least 100 acres, including rare, threatened, and endangered species locations, unique ecological communities, and migratory bird habitats; relatively pristine stream and river segments (which, when considered with adjacent forests and wetlands, are at least 100 acres) that support trout, mussels, and other sensitive aquatic organisms; and existing protected natural resource lands which contain one or more of the above (for example, state parks and forests, National Wildlife Refuges, locally owned reservoir properties, major stream valley parks, and Nature Conservancy preserves). In the GIA model, the above features were identified from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) spatial data that covered the entire state. Developed areas and major roads were excluded, areas less than 100 contiguous acres were dropped, adjacent forest and wetland were added to the remaining hubs, and the edges were smoothed. The average size of all hubs in the state is approximately 2200 acres.\n\n\nCorridors are linear features connecting hubs together to help animals and plant propagules to move between hubs. Corridors were identified using many sets of data, including land cover, roads, streams, slope, flood plains, aquatic resource data, and fish blockages. Generally speaking, corridors connect hubs of similar type (hubs containing forests are connected to one another; while those consisting primarily of wetlands are connected to others containing wetlands). Corridors generally follow the best ecological or \"most natural\" routes between hubs. Typically these are streams with wide riparian buffers and healthy fish communities. Other good wildlife corridors include ridge lines or forested valleys. Developed areas, major roads, and other unsuitable features were avoided.", "keyword": "green infrastructure,conservation,landscape ecology", "format": "application/zip; charset=binary", "created": "2013-03-15", "modified": "2014-10-24", "releaseDate": "2013-03-15", "theme": "Energy and Environment", "keywords": ["green infrastructure", "conservation", "landscape ecology"], "title": "Maryland Green Infrastructure Hubs and Corridors", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/file_data/NcyiCZUWvk9h0tC1-D5EBG5ETdQ7Qh_ieSmJREvZguw?filename=SWGIHubCor.zip", "formats": [{"value": "application/zip; charset=binary", "label": "application/zip; charset=binary"}]}], "accessLevel": "Public"}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cx3k-8nq5/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "feed": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cx3k-8nq5/rows.rss", "identifier": "cx3k-8nq5", "description": "The most popular baby names are generated by Maryland Vital Statistics data on birth records for the most current year of data available for publication (2011).", "keyword": "births,baby names,vital statistics administration", "format": "text/csv", "created": "2013-03-08", "modified": "2014-10-30", "releaseDate": "2013-03-08", "theme": "Health and Human Services", "keywords": ["births", "baby names", "vital statistics administration"], "title": "Maryland's Top Ten Most Popular Baby Names in 2011 by Race, Ethnicity, and Sex", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cx3k-8nq5/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "text/csv", "label": "csv"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cx3k-8nq5/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/json", "label": "json"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cx3k-8nq5/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml", "label": "xml"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cx3k-8nq5/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/xml+rdf", "label": "rdf"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cx3k-8nq5/rows.xls?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/excel", "label": "xls"}]}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cx3k-8nq5/rows.xlsx?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "formats": [{"value": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet", "label": "xlsx"}]}], "accessLevel": "Public", "webService": "https://data.maryland.gov/resource/cx3k-8nq5"}, {"accessURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/p93z-n4v3/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "feed": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/p93z-n4v3/rows.rss", "identifier": "p93z-n4v3", "description": "The Maryland Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), is a is a statewide telephone survey that tracks prevalence and trends over time for many health variables.
