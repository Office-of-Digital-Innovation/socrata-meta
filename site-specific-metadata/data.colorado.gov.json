Basic categories of information from the survey include age, sex, race, family and relationships, income and benefits, health insurance, education, veteran status, disabilities, occupancy basics, travel to work, and costs for some essentials (data related to cost of living). Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census.

Overcounts are known to exist in student and dual-residence populations, while undercounts are a given for homeless and illegal immigrants. Errors arise from both sampling and non-sampling methods. Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability. The long-form of the Census is distributed to a subset of households, and includes additional data related to households, economy, employment, occupation, as well as occupancy and building structure data. Household fields include: Total Households, Total Families, Households by Household Type by Household Size, Persons in Group Quarters by Detailed Group Quarters Type, Persons 25 Years and Over by Educational Attainment, Persons 16 Years and Over by Labor Force and Employment Status, Median Household Income, Median Family Income, Per Capita Income, Persons by Poverty Status in Previous Year. Occupancy fields include: Total Housing Units, Housing Units by Occupancy Status, Vacant Housing Units by Vacancy Status, Occupied Housing Units by Tenure, Median Housing Value, Median Contract Rent. The 2000 census marked the last year that the long form was distributed to 1 in 6 households (a 17% sample), and in 2010 the actual sample size for the long form was 2.5% per year (totaling 12.5% over a 5 year cycle). In 2000, one household answered the long form questions on behalf of 5 other households, and in 2010 a single household provides data for between seven other households (5 year averages) and 39 other households (1 year averages for larger places).", "keyword": "colorado,bic,dola,state demography office,blocks,census,tracts,counties,zip codes,zip,population,household,occupancy,occupation,building year built,gocode", "created": "2015-03-28", "title": "Co31", "modified": "2015-03-28", "dataset": "https://data.colorado.gov/resource/xipb-k5bu", "keywords": ["colorado", "bic", "dola", "state demography office", "blocks", "census", "tracts", "counties", "zip codes", "zip", "population", "household", "occupancy", "occupation", "building year built", "gocode"], "identifier": "e4iz-igyw"}], "accessLevel": "Public"}, {"accessURL": "https://data.colorado.gov/api/file_data/CJ2QUxVI8C-Ow5841GTmfnmHo705z1sqakFJbndKI5U?filename=ColoradoCAI2015GDB.zip", "license": "Public Domain\nState of Colorado, Governor's Office of Information Technology (OIT)", "identifier": "derv-m75k", "description": "This layer represents the National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) State Broadband Data Development Program (SBDD) Community Anchor Institutions (CAI) which subscribe to broadband.

The study area for this project includes all or portions of the following counties: Adams, Arapahoe, Jefferson, Denver, Douglas, Weld, Broomfield, and Boulder. Study area boundaries were defined to encompass the Denver Regional 2035 Urban Growth boundary, using the MPO boundary to the east and the mountain backdrop to the west. A fundamental milestone for this project was to create an up-to-date inventory of publicly accessible parks, green space, and trails. The dataset depicts publicly access parks and open space, with over 30 jurisdictions and organizations contributing data including: Counties: Adams Arapahoe Jefferson Denver Douglas Weld Broomfield Boulder Cities and Local Jurisdictions: Arvada Aurora Boulder Brighton Castle Rock Commerce City Golden Greenwood Village Highlands Ranch Ken Caryl Lakewood Littleton Longmont Louisville Parker Thornton Westminster Wheat Ridge Foot Hills Recreation District South Suburban Parks and Recreation Other Partners: Learning Landscapes DRCOG COMAP State of Colorado Colorado Open Lands", "keyword": "", "format": "application/octet-stream", "created": "2012-05-30", "modified": "2014-12-16", "releaseDate": "2012-05-30", "theme": "Recreation", "title": "Greenprint Data - Parks & Open Space", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "http://gis.drcog.org/datacatalog/content/greenprint-data-parks-open-space", "formats": [{"value": "application/octet-stream", "label": "open dataset source in new window"}]}], "accessLevel": "Public"}, {"accessURL": "http://gis.drcog.org/datacatalog/content/drcog-crash-data-points-2006", "identifier": "ihhr-267b", "description": "This file contains a record for each reported traffic crash in the Region.
