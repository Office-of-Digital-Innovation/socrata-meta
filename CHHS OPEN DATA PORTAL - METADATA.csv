The HO CDI SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of CDI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital in 2013 to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent CDI rate data.  CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO CDI incidence include the type of CDI test used by the hospital, if the hospital is affiliated with a medical school, hospital bed size, and the burden of community-onset CDI in patients admitted to the hospital.  Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals’ infections. For more precise comparisons, NHSN only calculates a SIR when at least one HO CDI is predicted, which is determined by patient volume and other factors predictive of acquiring CDI. However, we calculated the SIR for such hospitals with HO CDI predicted less than one if the number of HO CDI observed was greater than zero.  For each hospital with a CDI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number.  Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital’s CDI SIR as: 
• No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, 
• Higher - high or more infections than predicted, or 
• Lower - low or fewer infections than predicted.

Standardized Infection Ratios (SIR) adjusted for patient care locations for hospitals other than long-term and rehabilitation acute care. The CLABSI data for each hospital include number of observed (reported) CLABSIs, number of predicted CLABSIs (based on the national baseline data), number of central line-days, CLABSI SIRs and their 95% confidence intervals, and the statistical interpretation as follows:
•    No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections
•    High - more infections than predicted, or
•    Low - fewer infections than predicted
CLABSI SIRs are affected by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and maintenance practices, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance. While CLABSI SIRs are adjusted for patient care locations, they cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI SIRs. A low CLABSI SIR may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may reflect less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including failure to appropriately apply standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high SIR may reflect failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or more aggressive infection surveillance including more consistent application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Finally, SIRs cannot be compared across hospitals because of the ""indirect"" standardization methodology used in calculating the SIRs.

While stratifying CLABSI rates by patient care location makes rates more comparable, it cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI rates. A low CLABSI rate may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may reflect less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including failure to appropriately apply standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high rate may reflect failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or more aggressive infection surveillance including more consistent application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Finally, readers should consider comparisons between two time periods cautiously, as more time is needed to determine if changes will be sustained, and therefore, more meaningful.

The SIR is calculated by dividing the number of observed infections by the number of predicted infections. The number of predicted infections is calculated using SSI probabilities estimated from multivariate logistic regression models constructed from NHSN data during a baseline time period 2006 through 2008, which represents a reference population’s SSI experience. To enforce a minimum precision criterion, an SIR is calculated only if the number of observed infections is at least one. SIRs are based on the date of procedure, not the date of the SSI event. All procedure and infection data entered before May 1, 2014 for surgical procedures performed between January 1 and December 31, 2013 were downloaded from NHSN for this data release. The SIR used for this table is a risk adjusted SIR that considers only complex SSI identified during hospital admission or readmission to the same hospital following inpatient surgeries.

The HO MRSA BSI SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of MRSA BSI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital in 2013 to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent MRSA BSI rate data.  MRSA BSI cases are classified as HO when the first positive blood test is obtained after the third day of hospitalization. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO MRSA BSI incidence include hospital bed size, affiliation with a medical school, and the community burden of MRSA BSI as observed in patients admitted to the hospital. Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals’ infections. For more precise comparisons, NHSN only calculates a SIR when at least one HO MRSA BSI is predicted, which is determined by patient volume and other factors predictive of acquiring MRSA BSI. However, we calculated the SIR for such hospitals with HO MRSA BSI predicted less than one if the number of HO MRSA BSI observed was greater than zero. For each hospital with a MRSA BSI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number. Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital’s MRSA BSI SIR as: 
• No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, 
• Higher - high or more infections than predicted, or 
• Lower - low or fewer infections than predicted.

emt8-tzcf,3863,Chemicals in Cosmetics,"This data is from the California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP) in the California Department of Public Health. The primary purpose of the CSCP is to collect information on hazardous and potentially hazardous ingredients in cosmetic products sold in California and to make this information available to the public. For all cosmetic products sold in California, the California Safe Cosmetics Act requires the manufacturer, packer, and/or distributor named on the product label to provide to the CSCP a list of all cosmetic products that contain any ingredients known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects, or other developmental or reproductive harm. The CSCP maintains a list of “reportable” ingredients. Companies with reportable ingredients in their products must submit information to the California Safe Cosmetics Program if the company: •Has annual aggregate sales of cosmetic products of one million dollars or more, and •Has sold cosmetic products in California on or after January 1, 2007. The data table consists of: label names of cosmetic/personal care products, company/manufacturer names, product brand names, product categories, Chemical Abstracts Service registry numbers (CAS#) of the reported chemical ingredients, names of reported chemical ingredients, the number of reported chemicals for each product, and dates of reporting, product discontinuation or reformulation if applicable.
