  "description" : "The California Tobacco Advertising Survey (CTAS) is a longitudinal cohort study of California stores that sell cigarettes. The data table shows the percentage of stores with tobacco advertisements near candy and those with tobacco advertisements below three feet in 2008 and 2011, broken down by store type. Tobacco advertisements placed below three feet are easier for children to see, and advertisements near candy are in a location that is likely to draw a child's attention. The sampling excluded stores that required either club membership (e.g., Costco or golf courses) or had minimum-age restrictions (e.g., bars). Also excluded were stores that were unusual store categories that were unlikely to display or advertise tobacco products, such as donut shops. The baseline sample (CTAS 2008) is historical. The original sample was derived from a 1997 list of 40,186 cigarette retailers, as enumerated by the California Board of Equalization (BOE). The sample stores and addresses were matched to the 2011 retailer licensing list, which was supplied by the BOE to the California Tobacco Control Program. Of the 545 stores with valid data in 2008, 442 (81.1 percent) were verified by phone as still selling cigarettes. A randomly selected list of stores from the 2011 licensing list was also phone verified. This list was used to replace all 2008 stores that were no longer in business or no longer sold cigarettes. It was also used to increase the sample size by approximately 100 stores in order to better detect differences between store types.",

  "description" : "The Case Mix Index (CMI) is the average relative DRG weight of a hospital’s inpatient discharges, calculated by summing the Medicare Severity-Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) weight for each discharge and dividing the total by the number of discharges.  The CMI reflects the diversity, clinical complexity, and resource needs of all the patients in the hospital.  A higher CMI indicates a more complex and resource-intensive case load.  Although the MS-DRG weights, provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), were designed for the Medicare population, they are applied here to all discharges regardless of payer.  Note: It is not meaningful to add the CMI values together.",

  "description" : "The purpose of the California Wellness Plan (CWP) Data Reference Guide (Reference Guide) is to provide access to the lowest-level data for each CWP Objective; lowest-level data source, instructions to access data, and additional details are described. Some CWP Objectives do not have program leads, data sources, baselines, and/or targets, but are included because they were a result of CDPH program or partner input and were felt to be important to the reduction of chronic disease incidence, prevalence, and health disparities. Agencies, programs and/or partners identified with an objective may be either data stewards and/or engaged in activities to achieve the target, but may not have adequate resources for statewide activities.  Developmental Objectives will be updated as information becomes available. \r\n\r\nBackground: The California Wellness Plan, California's Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Plan was released February 2014 by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).  The overarching goal of CWP is Equity in Health and Wellbeing; additional CWP Goals include: 1) Healthy Communities, 2) Optimal Health Systems Linked with Community Prevention, 3) Accessible and Usable Health Information, and 4) Prevention  Sustainability and Capacity. All CWP objectives fall under the framework of Let's Get Healthy California Task Force priorities.",

  "description" : "This table shows the Center for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) standardized infection ratios (SIR) of hospital onset (HO) Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) reported by  California general acute care hospitals other than long-term and rehabilitation acute care hospitals.  The HO CDI SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of CDI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital in 2013 to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent CDI rate data.  CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO CDI incidence include the type of CDI test used by the hospital, if the hospital is affiliated with a medical school, hospital bed size, and the burden of community-onset CDI in patients admitted to the hospital.  Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals’ infections. For more precise comparisons, NHSN only calculates a SIR when at least one HO CDI is predicted, which is determined by patient volume and other factors predictive of acquiring CDI. However, we calculated the SIR for such hospitals with HO CDI predicted less than one if the number of HO CDI observed was greater than zero.  For each hospital with a CDI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number.  Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital’s CDI SIR as: \r\n• No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, \r\n• Higher - high or more infections than predicted, or \r\n• Lower - low or fewer infections than predicted.\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf",

Viruses carried in the mosquito’s saliva enter the blood stream and local tissues where they infect immune cells. Most of the people who do become sick during a WNV infection develop what is referred to as “West Nile fever.” A small percentage of people will develop a much more serious illness called West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND).

  "description" : "Wards General Care Areas include the following types of locations: stepdown general care locations specializing in patients that are hemodynamically stable; medical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of nonsurgical conditions; medical/surgical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of medical and/or surgical conditions; surgical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment for pre- or post-surgical conditions; long-term acute care locations specializing in patients requiring an extended stay in an acute care environment; rehabilitation general care locations providing care to patients who have lost function;  labor, delivery, postpartum general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of normal and high risk pregnancy patients; behavioral general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of patients with acute psychiatric or behavioral disorders; jail general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of patients who are in custody of law enforcement during their treatment; and pediatric general care locations providing evaluation or treatment to any patient less than or equal to 18 years of age for any medical or surgical condition. This table shows the hospital-specific central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) data by patient care locations classified as Wards. The CLABSI data for each hospital patient care location include number of CLABSIs, central line-days and patient days, CLABSI rates per 1000 line days and their 95% confidence intervals. We also performed a statistical analysis to determine if the rates are statistically higher, lower, or no different than California average rates. California average rates for 2013 can be found at http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/hai/Documents/2013-CLABSI-T1.pdf. CLABSI rates are affected by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and maintenance practices, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance methods. While stratifying CLABSI rates by patient care location makes rates more comparable, it cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI rates. A low CLABSI rate may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may reflect less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including failure to appropriately apply standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high rate may reflect failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or more aggressive infection surveillance including more consistent application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Finally, readers should consider comparisons between two time periods cautiously, as more time is needed to determine if changes will be sustained, and therefore, more meaningful.

  "description" : "This table shows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) methods. Standardized Infection Ratios (SIR) adjusted for patient care locations for hospitals other than long-term and rehabilitation acute care. The CLABSI data for each hospital include number of observed (reported) CLABSIs, number of predicted CLABSIs (based on the national baseline data), number of central line-days, CLABSI SIRs and their 95% confidence intervals, and the statistical interpretation as follows:\r\n•    No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections\r\n•    High - more infections than predicted, or\r\n•    Low - fewer infections than predicted\r\nCLABSI SIRs are affected by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and maintenance practices, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance. While CLABSI SIRs are adjusted for patient care locations, they cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI SIRs. A low CLABSI SIR may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may reflect less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including failure to appropriately apply standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high SIR may reflect failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or more aggressive infection surveillance including more consistent application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Finally, SIRs cannot be compared across hospitals because of the \"indirect\" standardization methodology used in calculating the SIRs.

  "description" : "Special Care Areas (SCA) are nursing care areas which specialize in patients who undergo bone marrow (stem cell) transplant for the treatment of various disorders; or require management and treatment for cancer and/or blood disorders; or require postoperative care after solid organ transplant. This table shows the hospital-specific central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) data by patient care locations in Special Care Areas. The CLABSI data for each hospital patient care location include number of CLABSIs, central line-days and patient days, CLABSI rates per 1000 line days and their 95% confidence intervals. We also performed a statistical analysis to determine if the rates are statistically higher, lower, or no different than California average rates. California average rates for 2013 can be found at http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/hai/Documents/2013-CLABSI-T1.pdf. CLABSI rates are affected by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and maintenance practices, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance methods. While stratifying CLABSI rates by patient care location makes rates more comparable, it cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI rates. A low CLABSI rate may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may reflect less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including failure to appropriately apply standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high rate may reflect failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or more aggressive infection surveillance including more consistent application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Finally, readers should consider comparisons between two time periods cautiously, as more time is needed to determine if changes will be sustained, and therefore, more meaningful.

  "description" : "This table shows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) risk adjusted standardized infection ratios (SIR) for surgical site infections (SSIs) reported by hospitals for 24 operative procedures that are listed in the Data Dictionary. The SIR is calculated by dividing the number of observed infections by the number of predicted infections. The number of predicted infections is calculated using SSI probabilities estimated from multivariate logistic regression models constructed from NHSN data during a baseline time period 2006 through 2008, which represents a reference population’s SSI experience. To enforce a minimum precision criterion, an SIR is calculated only if the number of observed infections is at least one. SIRs are based on the date of procedure, not the date of the SSI event. All procedure and infection data entered before May 1, 2014 for surgical procedures performed between January 1 and December 31, 2013 were downloaded from NHSN for this data release. The SIR used for this table is a risk adjusted SIR that considers only complex SSI identified during hospital admission or readmission to the same hospital following inpatient surgeries. The procedure counts and infection counts submitted by each hospital are displayed along with an SIR, the 95 percent confidence interval for the SIR, and the statistical comparison as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       *    No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  •    High -  more infections than predicted,  or\r\n•    Low - fewer infections than predicted\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf",

  "description" : "This table shows the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) standardized infection ratios (SIR) of hospital onset (HO) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream Infections (MRSA BSI) reported by  California general acute care hospitals other than long-term and rehabilitation acute care hospitals. The HO MRSA BSI SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of MRSA BSI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital in 2013 to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent MRSA BSI rate data.  MRSA BSI cases are classified as HO when the first positive blood test is obtained after the third day of hospitalization. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO MRSA BSI incidence include hospital bed size, affiliation with a medical school, and the community burden of MRSA BSI as observed in patients admitted to the hospital. Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals’ infections. For more precise comparisons, NHSN only calculates a SIR when at least one HO MRSA BSI is predicted, which is determined by patient volume and other factors predictive of acquiring MRSA BSI. However, we calculated the SIR for such hospitals with HO MRSA BSI predicted less than one if the number of HO MRSA BSI observed was greater than zero. For each hospital with a MRSA BSI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number. Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital’s MRSA BSI SIR as: \r\n• No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, \r\n• Higher - high or more infections than predicted, or \r\n• Lower - low or fewer infections than predicted.\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf",

  "description" : "Long-term acute care is a hospital defined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as a licensed general acute care hospital providing care for patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay for all patients of greater than 25 days. This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) and use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reported by California long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals.  The hospital onset (HO) CDI rate is calculated by dividing the number of HO CDI cases by the total inpatient days. The rates are not risk adjusted and may reflect factors in the hospital that can affect the occurrence of CDI, such as transmission of the C. difficile bacteria and use of antimicrobials. CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Differences in rates for LTAC hospitals can result from differences in laboratory testing methodology, patient populations, infection and transmission prevention practices, antibiotic utilization, and/or community onset rates of CDI. HO CDI rate in LTAC hospitals is provided separately from the rates in rehabilitation acute care hospitals.  Patients in LTAC hospitals have longer lengths of stay, an established risk factor for CDI.  Also, specifically for LTAC and rehabilitation acute care hospitals, we include whether a hospital uses the polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) to detect CDI.  In this table, hospital rates of CDI for LTAC hospitals have not been adjusted to account for the differences in sensitivity between PCR and other laboratory testing methods; therefore, rates from hospitals using different types of laboratory tests are not comparable.

  "description" : "Living HIV and AIDS cases by gender, race/ethnicity, current age group, and exposure category in California, 2012.  Table includes all persons living with HIV or AIDS whose last known residence is in California (regardless of state of diagnosis). Living status, current age group and HIV status (HIV or AIDS) are as of December 31, 2012, using data reported by December 31, 2013. AIDS is diagnosed when the immune system of a person infected with HIV becomes severely compromised, which is identified either by low CD4 cell count (<200 cells/µL) or the person becomes ill with an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection or illness. Rates per 100,000 persons are based on population estimates from the California Department of Finance. Dash (-) indicates the rates could not be calculated due to unknown population denominators. Gender is determined by both current gender and sex at birth variables; transgender values are assigned when current gender is identified as \"Transgender\" or when a discrepancy is identified between a person's sex at birth and their current gender (e.g., cases where sex at birth is \"Male\" and current gender is \"Female\" will become Transgender: Male to Female.) Prior to 2003, Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders were classified as one combined group. In order to present these race/ethnicities separately, living cases recorded under this combined classification were split and redistributed according to their expected proportional population representation estimated from post-2003 data.",

The primary purpose of the CSCP is to collect information on hazardous and potentially hazardous ingredients in cosmetic products sold in California and to make this information available to the public. For all cosmetic products sold in California, the California Safe Cosmetics Act requires the manufacturer, packer, and/or distributor named on the product label to provide to the CSCP a list of all cosmetic products that contain any ingredients known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects, or other developmental or reproductive harm. The CSCP maintains a list of “reportable” ingredients. Companies with reportable ingredients in their products must submit information to the California Safe Cosmetics Program if the company: •Has annual aggregate sales of cosmetic products of one million dollars or more, and •Has sold cosmetic products in California on or after January 1, 2007. The data table consists of: label names of cosmetic/personal care products, company/manufacturer names, product brand names, product categories, Chemical Abstracts Service registry numbers (CAS#) of the reported chemical ingredients, names of reported chemical ingredients, the number of reported chemicals for each product, and dates of reporting, product discontinuation or reformulation if applicable. The data reflect information that has been reported to the CSCP. All products containing carcinogens or developmental or reproductive toxicants may not be included, due to companies failing to report.",
